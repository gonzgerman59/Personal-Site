    <p class=".pelijah">Santa Ana (Calif.) Mater Dei has four prospects in the Top247 that the Bruins have offered- the highest being quarterback Elijah Brown.
        Brown, the first player UCLA offered in the class of 2024, is the No. 17 prospect nationally in the 2024 class, the No. 3 quarterback and the new No. 1 player in the Golden State. This is a big offer considering Dorian Thompson-Robinson is going to be gone.</p>

      <p>San Diego (Calif.) Mater Dei Catholic four-star wide receiver Jeremiah McClure revealed his commitment and it is to our UCLA bruins. “I have a great relationship with the coaching staff and felt like UCLA was the best combination of academics and football,” McClure said. “I like the offense and think it’s a good fit for me.
        “When I watched the team play, it looked like they need someone who can stretch the field and I think I can be that guy for them. I’ve enjoyed watching them play this year and I think their program is going in the right direction and I’m excited to be a part of that.”
